<h2>Best Pasta recipe</h2>
<p>Alfredo sauce is one of my favorite things to have with a big bowl of pasta!  It’s a very rich and indulgent treat for dinner.  I also love that it only takes about 5-10 minutes to whip up a batch!  This recipe will yield about two cups of sauce total.  It can easily be doubled if you are feeding a crowd or want extra for later.  The bottled Alfredo just doesn’t compare to this delicious homemade version!  If you love cooking from scratch, make some of this <strong>Homemade</strong> Pasta to go along with your sauce!</p>
